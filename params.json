{"name":"Second Round Sports  Half Court","tagline":"A mobile platform for the gamification of pickup basketball","body":"# Second Round Sports\r\n\r\nThe Half Court project is the first of the [Second Round Sports](http://secondroundsports.com/) product family.  The app is available from the [iTunes App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/half-court/id714439453) for iOS 6.0+, on the iPhone.\r\n\r\nEmerged from [Startup Weekend Vancouver](http://vancouver.startupweekend.org/events/startup-weekend-vancouver-may-2013/) and a honourable mention by [BC Business Magazine](http://www.bcbusiness.ca/tech-science/entrepreneurs-cut-teeth-at-startup-weekend-vancouver?utm_source=MagMail&utm_medium=BCBusiness+Newsletter&utm_campaign=BCBusiness+enewsletter+05June2013), Second Round Sports is a gamification platform, in which game mechanics are applied to engage users in everyday activities. In the case for Second Round Sports, the activities are pick-up sports. It evolves from the concept of MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games) in which players far apart interact with one another in a computer game via the Internet. We bring similar experience to real, physical pick-up sports, such as pick-up basketball. Players play their pick-up sports as usual in their favourite playground, and by doing so they are competing with players across the world. It, in effect, turns the sports that people play everyday into a large scale tournament. In addition, it adds computer game features such as leaderboards, which is a natural fit, to pick-up sports.\r\n\r\n[Watch the original pitch by the developer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlxlWTHZqq8)\r\n\r\n# Setup\r\nThe app was originally developed with XCode 4.3, for iOS6.  \r\nThe backend uses service from [Parse](https://www.parse.com/).\r\nIn addition, [Kiip](http://www.kiip.me/) was included to provide users with reward as they move up on the leaderboard.\r\n\r\nPlease follow instructions from [Parse](https://www.parse.com/) and [Kiip](http://www.kiip.me/) to install the frameworks into this XCode project. \r\n\r\n# Contact\r\ninfo@secondroundsports.com","google":"UA-40958814-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
